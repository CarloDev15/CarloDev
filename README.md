![CarloDev Screenshot](src/images/vue-carlodev-preview.png)

## 🌟 Overview

**CarloDev** is a portfolio website developed with Vue.js as the final project for my Vue course exam. This site provides a fun overview of my journey as a developer, featuring humorous easter eggs that reflect my personality and development style. It’s a simple yet polished project, with three main pages and a fully responsive design.

🔗 **Live Demo**: [CarloDev Demo](https://carlodev-vue.netlify.app/)

## 🚀 Key Features

- **3 Interactive Pages**:

  - **Home**: A brief introduction to me as a developer, paired with humorous stats like _25k+ Stars on GitHub (with Bot)_ and _91% Negative feedback_.
  - **Projects**: A list of fake projects, presented in a clean and modern card format.
  - **About**: A playful "about me" page, featuring a description of Vue.js instead of my bio, and a humorous Simpsons character image that updates on each page load.

- **Easter Eggs & Humor**: Along with playful project stats and feedback percentages, the _About_ page uses a purposely misleading description focusing on Vue.js rather than my actual biography.

- **API Calls**: Integration with a free external API, [Simpsons Quote API](https://thesimpsonsquoteapi.glitch.me/quotes), which dynamically returns a new Simpsons character image with each visit to the _About_ page.

- **Fully Responsive**: The design is optimized for all screen sizes, with special attention to mobile views, including an "hamburger" menu for navigation.

- **Minimalistic Design with TailwindCSS**: A clean and lightweight interface built with TailwindCSS for a fast and modern look.

- **Animations with Vue Transition**: Smooth component animations using Vue’s built-in transition system for an enhanced user experience.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Vue.js**: JavaScript framework for building dynamic user interfaces.
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: For application logic.
- **TailwindCSS**: For a modern, responsive design.
- **Vue Transition**: To create fluid transitions between components.
- **Simpsons Quote API**: To dynamically generate Simpsons character images on the _About_ page.

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash

## 🎨 Design & Development

**CarloDev** was fully designed and developed by me as a learning project to master Vue.js and build a complete portfolio website. I wanted to explore new technologies and workflows, creating a site that showcases both my technical skills.

## 🙏 Credits

A special thanks to [Simpsons Quote API](https://thesimpsonsquoteapi.glitch.me/) for providing the images and quotes that bring fun to my site.
